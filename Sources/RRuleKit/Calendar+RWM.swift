    ///
    ///  Examples:
    ///    - To find out how many Tuesdays there are in 2018, pass in `3` for the `weekday` and `2018` for the `year`
    /// and the default of `0` for the `month`.
    ///    - To find out how many Saturdays there are in May of 2018, pass in `7` for the `weekday`, `2018` for the
    /// `year`, and `5` for the `month`.
    ///    - To find out how many Mondays there are in the last month of 2018, pass in `2` for the `weekday`, `2018` for
    /// the `year`, and `-1` for the `month`.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - weekday: The day of the week. Values range from 1 to 7, with Sunday being 1.
    ///   - year: A calendar year.
    ///   - month: A month within the calendar year. The value of `0` means the month is ignored. Negative values start
    /// from the last month of the year. `-1` is the last month. `-2` is the next-to-last month, etc.
    /// - Returns: A range from `1` through `n` where `n` is the number of times the given weekday appears in the year
    /// or month of the year. If `month` is out of range for the year, the result is `nil`.
